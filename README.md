# Details
On the second step, in the optimize tab, you're given details on what will be handled.
- 'Make Duplicate' will make a backup of your controller before proceeding.
- 'Replace' will delete the layer for the toggle that will be optimized.
- 'Active' will determine wether this toggle will be handled or not.
- Yellow warning icon appears if the toggle behaviour may change when optimized, such as with dissolve toggles.
- Red warning icon appears if optimizing this toggle may break some functionality, such as with exclusive toggles through parameter drivers.
- Foldout is to see or change what start and end motions will be used for this toggle.

### Notes
You should almost always make backups in case something doesn't work right.  
After running the tool, you should test whether they work with [this emulator](https://github.com/lyuma/Av3Emulator).  
If something doesn't work, you can go back to optimize the original again and disable 'Active' for the toggles that didn't work.

### Warning
The optimizer does not take into account layer priority. If an optimized toggle has overlapping clips with another clip, there may be change in behaviour where properties get overwritten.

## Planned Features
- Implement float smoothing for clip blending. i.e: dissolves
- Make the builder for faster and easier tree building
